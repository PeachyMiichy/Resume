                Dedicated and experienced program coordinator seeking a new
                career path to expand my experience and skill set. Highly
                adaptable and flexible, I am able to perform proactive
                coordination and execution of time-sensitive tasks. Juggling
                multiple programs for Orthopedic Surgery and Anesthesia
                departments, cultivated an incredible capacity to multi-task and
                thrive under pressure in a fast-paced environment with minimal
                supervision.<br /><br />
                With a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering, I am
                passionate about system improvements and streamlining processes.
                Equipped with the skills for data analysis, optimization and
                project management, I am keen to take on new challenges and
                projects. I am also a keen learner and am enthusiastic to learn
                new skills, such as web development which was how I coded this
                resume.
